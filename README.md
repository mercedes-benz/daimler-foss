# Mercedes-Benz Group and FOSS
Open Source emerged to play an important role in our products and now it's time to give back to the FOSS community. We contribute to projects, open source our own software products here on GitHub.com/mercedes-benz and we are sponsoring several open source projects. You can follow our open source journey on our [landing page](https://opensource.mercedes-benz.com/) and have a look behind the scenes.
Overall we are giving our best to be a good citizen in the open source community.
